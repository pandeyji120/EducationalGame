 EducationalGame: Learn and Play on the Blockchain

**Vision**

EducationalGame is a blockchain-based platform designed to revolutionize learning by making it interactive, engaging, and rewarding.  Students can participate in educational games, track their progress through verifiable scores stored on the blockchain, and even earn rewards for their achievements.

**Flowchart**

A basic flowchart for EducationalGame could look like this:

1. User starts the application.
2. User chooses to register or login (if already registered).
3. If registering, user provides a name.
4. System validates user input and registers the player.
5. User can play educational games.
6. Upon game completion, the score is sent to the contract.
7. Contract verifies the sender and updates the player's score.
8. User can view their score and total players registered.
9. (For future implementation) Users with high scores can be eligible for rewards issued by the contract owner.
